<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
After the plugin is installed will it automatically be used by the NP_LMCommentModerator plugin to check for spam comments.
</p>

<h3>Stop Forum Spam</h3>

<p>
This plugin does not implement Stop Forum Spam submissions based on moderator comment categorization. 
</p>

<p>
The reason for this is that the NP_LMCommentModerator plugin does not verify EMail addresses of non-member authors,
and Stop Forum Spam requires that any EMail addresses submitted has been verified.
